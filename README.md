# Power BI Interactive Dashboards

## Overview
This project includes multiple interactive dashboards built in Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize business performance across different dimensions, including sales, product performance, and employee performance. The dashboards provide insightful trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and data-driven decision-making support.

## Key Features

- **Product Performance Dashboard:** Analyzes top-performing products, sales distribution across categories, and demand trends.
- **Employee Performance Dashboard:** Evaluates employee contributions to sales, performance trends, and key contributors.
- **Dynamic Filters & Slicers:** Enables users to interact with the data and gain customized insights.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identifies relationships between various business metrics for better decision-making.

## Insights & Findings
- Sales increased by **111.95%** between 2013 and 2015, indicating strong revenue growth.
- The highest sales occurred in **November**, which was **332.01%** higher than the lowest sales month.
- Employee **Janet Leverling** contributed the highest total sales, **932.59%** more than the lowest performer.
- A negative correlation was observed between the count of orders and quarterly sales, suggesting demand fluctuations.
